There are three shorter (2.54 \u00c5) and three longer (2.59 \u00c5) Cu(1)-Cu(1) bond lengths.", "output": "[[138.0, 67.0, 67.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [67.0, 138.0, 67.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [67.0, 67.0, 138.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 54.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 54.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 54.0]]"}]
